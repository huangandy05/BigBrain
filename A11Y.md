Accessibility has been improved with the use of a very simple colour scheme.
Users can see clearly that buttons are pressable because they are very contrasting
to the background colour - they are usually either red or blue, contrasting the white.

In addition, our pages feature very simple layouts where buttons are placed in
convenient places. For example, all of the pages are centre aligned, meaning
the mouse does not have to move much from the centre of the page when interacting
with features. In addition, the simple navigation bar allows admins to return
to the dashboard at any time on any page.

We also put much thought into the sizing of our buttons and made sure
they were visible and clickable without being overbearing. For example,
the answer questions buttons are wide depending on the viewport, making them easy
to click for players.
